# Auto Tag

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GorillaStack/auto-tag.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GorillaStack/auto-tag)

This is an open-source tagging solution for AWS.  Deploy AutoTag to Lambda using CloudTrail with either S3 Logs or CloudWatch Events and have each of your resources tagged with the ARN of who created it. Optionally, resources can be tagged with when it was created and which AWS service invoked the request if one is provided.  It was written by [GorillaStack](http://www.gorillastack.com/).

[Read a blog post about the project](http://blog.gorillastack.com/gorillastack-presents-auto-tag).


## About

Automatically tagging resources can greatly improve the ease of cost allocation and governance.

Two options are available to process the CloudTrail event stream, a S3 put object trigger on the associated CloudTrail S3 bucket, or a CloudWatch Events rule trigger. 

CloudTrail logs (S3 objects) are delivered in batches to the CloudTrail S3 bucket every 5 to 7 minutes after a supported resource type is created. CloudTrail will write the S3 logs which triggers our AutoTag code to tag the resource. The lambda function is executed once for each S3 object, each S3 object log contains a batch of CloudTrail Events to be processed. Every event in the log must be processed, even if it is not supported, this is somewhat inefficient. This can be a quick solution if CloudTrail is already enabled for all regions and/or accounts in your environment. This solution will function cross-account with a supplemental role in each remote account.

CloudWatch events delivers a near real-time stream of CloudTrail events as soon as a supported resource type is created. CloudWatch event rules triggers our AutoTag code to tag the resource. This method does not require CloudTrail logs to be sent to a S3 bucket. In this configuration the lambda function is executed once each time it is triggered by the CloudWatch Event Rule (one event at a time). The CloudWatch Event Rule includes a pattern filter so it is only triggered by the supported events which is much more efficient. I saw about an 85% decrease in invocations of the lambda function in comparison to the S3 log method. 

There are two separate CloudFormation templates for CloudWatch Events, the first is a simple template setup that will only function for a single region. In this solution CloudWatch events can trigger the lambda function directly because they are in the same region. The second option is a multi-region and single account solution, here the CloudWatch events are delivered to in-region SNS topics and then the SNS topic delivers that event to the main lambda function in the main region. Any number of regions can be setup for tagging and it only requires a single lambda function per account. 


## Installation

### Generate the Lambda zip package
#### Redhat 7.4

```bash
cd ~
curl "https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py" -o "get-pip.py"
sudo python get-pip.py
sudo pip install awscli
sudo yum -y install gcc-c++ make git zip
sudo curl -sL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -

cd auto-tag
npm install --save
mv node_modules/ lib/
npm install grunt-run --save-dev
cd lib/
grunt run:babel-once 
zip -r9 auto-tag-0.9.0.zip -x\*.zip * -q
```

### Pick a Deployment Method
#### Deploy with Console (S3 Object Method)

__CloudFormation Main Stack__ Deploy this stack first in a single "master" region, probably in the same region as your CloudTrail S3 Bucket. This stack deploys the lambda function and permissions for the bucket.

1. In the git files on your local machine change directory to `cloud_formation/s3object_template`
1. Go to the [CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home)
1. Click the blue "Create Stack" button
1. Select "Upload a template to Amazon S3", choosing the downloaded [CloudFormation template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GorillaStack/auto-tag/master/cloud_formation/s3object_template/autotag_s3object_main-template.json), then click the blue "Next" button
1. Name the stack "AutoTag" - this name can be anything
1. In the parameter section:
  * CloudTrailBucketName: Name the S3 bucket that the template will create.  This needs to be unique for the region, so select something specific
  * CodeS3Bucket: The name of the code bucket in S3 ~~As mentioned, we have a version of AutoTag in each region, to make deployment easy regardless of what region you are deploying your CloudFormation template.  Edit this parameter to match your region.  It should have the following pattern: gorillastack-autotag-releases-${regionId}.  E.g. gorillastack-autotag-releases-ap-northeast-1, gorillastack-autotag-releases-us-west-2~~
  * CodeS3Path: This is the version of AutoTag that you wish to deploy.  The default value `autotag-0.3.0.zip` is the latest version
  * AutoTagDebugLogging: Enable/Disable Debug Logging for the Lambda Function for **all** processed CloudTrail events
  * AutoTagDebugLoggingOnFailure: Enable/Disable Debug Logging when the Lambda Function has a failure
  * AutoTagTagsCreateTime: Enable/Disable the "CreateTime" tagging for all resources
  * AutoTagTagsInvokedBy: Enable/Disable the "InvokedBy" tagging for all resources (when it is provided)
  
  
__CloudFormation Role Stack__ Use this stack if you have a single CloudTrail S3 Bucket that receives CloudTrail logs from multiple accounts. Deploy this stack in any of your remote accounts that you would like to have auto tagging. This stack deploys a IAM role that allows the main stack's lambda function to perform tagging in the remote account. 

1. In the git files on your local machine change directory to `cloud_formation/s3object_template`
1. Go to the [CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home)
1. Click the blue "Create Stack" button
1. Select "Upload a template to Amazon S3", choosing the downloaded [CloudFormation template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GorillaStack/auto-tag/master/cloud_formation/s3object_template/autotag_s3object_role-template.json), then click the blue "Next" button
1. Name the stack "AutoTag-Role" - this name can be anything
1. In the parameter section:
  * MainStackName: The name of the name of the main stack
  * MainAwsAccountNumber: The account number where the main auto-tag CloudFormation stack is running


#### Deploy with Console (CloudWatch Events Method - Single Region)

1. Go to the [CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home)
1. Click the blue "Create Stack" button
1. Select "Upload a template to Amazon S3", choosing the downloaded [CloudFormation template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GorillaStack/auto-tag/master/cloud_formation/event_single_region_template/autotag_event-template.json), then click the blue "Next" button
1. Name the stack "AutoTag" - this name can be anything
1. In the parameter section:
* CodeS3Bucket: The name of the code bucket in S3
* CodeS3Path: This is the version of AutoTag that you wish to deploy.  The default value `autotag-0.3.0.zip` is the latest version
* AutoTagDebugLogging: Enable/Disable Debug Logging for the Lambda Function for **all** processed CloudTrail events
* AutoTagDebugLoggingOnFailure: Enable/Disable Debug Logging when the Lambda Function has a failure
* AutoTagTagsCreateTime: Enable/Disable the "CreateTime" tagging for all resources
* AutoTagTagsInvokedBy: Enable/Disable the "InvokedBy" tagging for all resources (when it is provided)  


#### Deploy with Console (CloudWatch Events Method - Multi-Region)


__CloudFormation Main Stack__ Deploy this stack first in a single "master" region. This stack deploys the lambda function and permissions for each region. (Note: this requires an up-to-date ruby SDK to be aware of the latest regions)

1. In the git files on your local machine change directory to `cloud_formation/event_multi_region_template`
1. The next step requires a install of ruby and ruby's bundler
1. Run `bundle install` to install the ruby dependencies to build the template
1. Running the ruby template builder helps to build a Lambda::InvokePermission for each region (SDK version dependent) `./autotag_event_main-template.rb expand > autotag_event_main-template.json`
1. Go to the [CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home)
1. Click the CloudFormation drop-down button and select "Stack"
1. Click the blue "Create Stack" button
1. Select "Upload a template to Amazon S3", choosing the `autotag_event_main-template.json` that was created in the ruby template builder step, then click the blue "Next" button
1. Name the stack "AutoTag" - this cannot be changed
1. In the parameter section:
* CodeS3Bucket: The name of the code bucket in S3
* CodeS3Path: This is the version of AutoTag that you wish to deploy.  The default value `autotag-0.3.0.zip` is the latest version
* AutoTagDebugLogging: Enable/Disable Debug Logging for the Lambda Function for **all** processed CloudTrail events
* AutoTagDebugLoggingOnFailure: Enable/Disable Debug Logging when the Lambda Function has a failure
* AutoTagTagsCreateTime: Enable/Disable the "CreateTime" tagging for all resources
* AutoTagTagsInvokedBy: Enable/Disable the "InvokedBy" tagging for all resources (when it is provided)
  
  
__CloudFormation Collector StackSet__ After the main stack status is CREATE_COMPLETE deploy the collector stack to each region where AWS resources should be tagged. This stack deploys the CloudWatch Event Rule and the SNS Topic. (Note: Extra setup is required for deploying StackSets. Using StackSets is not actually necessary for this step, it is just a simple way to deploy CloudFormation templates to multiple regions.)
1. Read about the [CloudFormation StackSet Concepts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-concepts.html)
1. Follow the instructions in the [CloudFormation StackSet Prerequisites](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-prereqs.html) Using the two templates AWS provide is the most simple way: [AWSCloudFormationStackSetAdministrationRole.yml](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-stackset-sample-templates-us-east-1/AWSCloudFormationStackSetAdministrationRole.yml) and [AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole.yml](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-stackset-sample-templates-us-east-1/AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole.yml)
1. Go to the [CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home)
1. Click the blue "Create StackSet" button
1. Provide the local account number and the regions to deploy to, then click the blue "Next" button
1. Select "Upload a template to Amazon S3", choosing the downloaded [CloudFormation template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GorillaStack/auto-tag/master/cloud_formation/event_multi_region_template/autotag_event_collector-template.json), then click the blue "Next" button
1. Name the stack "AutoTag-Collector" - this name can be anything
1. In the parameter section:
* MainAwsRegion: The region where the main auto-tag CloudFormation stack will be running



## Supported Resource Types

Currently Auto-Tag, supports the following AWS resource types

WARNING: When tag-able resources are created using CloudFormation __StackSets__ the "Creator" tag is NEVER populated with the ARN of the user who executed the StackSet, instead it is tagged with the less useful CloudFormation StackSet Execution Role's "assumed-role" ARN. 

__Tags Applied__: C=Creator, T=Create Time, I=Invoked By

## Deny Create/Delete/Edit for AutoTags

Use the following IAM policy to deny a user or role the ability to create, delete, and edit any tag starting with 'AutoTag_'. At the time of this writing the deny tag IAM condition (aws:TagKeys) is only available for resources in EC2 and AutoScaling, see the table above for a status of each resource.

```json
{
  "Sid": "DenyAutoTagPrefix",
  "Effect": "Deny",
  "Action": [
    "ec2:CreateTags",
    "ec2:DeleteTags",
    "autoscaling:CreateOrUpdateTags",
    "autoscaling:DeleteTags"
  ],
  "Condition": {
    "ForAnyValue:StringLike": {
      "aws:TagKeys": "AutoTag_*"
    }
  },
  "Resource": "*"
}
```


## Retro-active Tagging

#### Query CloudTrail logs using AWS Athena

Use AWS Athena to scan your history of CloudTrail logs in S3 and retro-actively tag existing AWS resources. You are charged based on the amount the data that is scanned.

Create Table Query
```sql

If you have questions, feature requests or bugs to report, please do so on [the issues section of our github repository](https://github.com/GorillaStack/auto-tag/issues).

If you are interested in contributing, please get started by forking our github repository and submit pull-requests.


### Development guide

#### General

Auto tag is implemented in Javascript (ECMAScript 2015 - a.k.a. es6).

When the repository was first authored, this was not supported by the lambda node version (v0.10).  [Even now with version 4.3 support](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/node-js-4-3-2-runtime-now-available-on-lambda/), we still need to transpile code to es5 for compatibility, as not all language features are available (e.g. import etc)...[with nodejs 6.10](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/03/aws-lambda-supports-node-js-6-10/) we still can't run this code natively.


##### Support for es5

If you still wish to transpile to es5 for older node versions run the following:

```bash
$ grunt run:babel  # runs interactively, issue ^C to existing
```

Export the generated es5 `lib/` directory to AWS rather than the es6 `src/` directory.
